## [L-01] No check if `source == target` in `_processDelegation`

## Impact

If we provide the same source and target addresses, the function will execute successfully but won't result in any modifications.
This is because it invokes the **`token.transferFrom()`** function, which merely deducts the specified amount from the source address and then immediately credits it back to the same address. This behavior occurs because the default implementation of **`ERC20:transferFrom`** does not validate whether the source and target addresses are the same.

## Recommendation

Add a check if `source == target` to prevent the user from paying for gas.

```diff
163	function transferBetweenDelegators(
164		address from,
165		address to,
166		uint256 amount
167	) internal {
+               require(from != to)
169		address proxyAddressFrom = retrieveProxyContractAddress(token, from);
170		address proxyAddressTo = retrieveProxyContractAddress(token, to);
171		token.transferFrom(proxyAddressFrom, proxyAddressTo, amount);
172	}
```

## [L-02] No check if `amount == 0`

## Impact

There is no validation whether amount transferred is greater than 0. As a result many proxies will be deployed but they wonâ€™t have any funds and therefore will result in a waste of gas and not giving any value to the delegator.

## [L-03] **Tokens and Ether mistakenly sent to contracts cannot be recovered**

## Impact

The `ERC20MultiDelegate` and `ERC20ProxyDelegator` contracts lack functions for `sweep/recover` mistakenly sent tokens or Ether.

Users might assume they should transfer their ENS tokens to the `ERC20MultiDelegate`, expecting it to forward them to the proxy.

Alternatively, they may see any proxy address from the mempool and send their tokens there, under the assumption that this action delegates their votes.

## Recommendation

Consider adding this type of function and restrict it to only be callable by the protocol admin.

## [L-04] Everyone can delegate to themselves

The **`_delegateMulti()`** function allows self-delegation because it doesn't check if the target is equal to **`msg.sender`**.The **`ERC20Votes:delegate`** function also lacks this check, resulting in the ability to self-delegate which goes against the contract's intended purpose.

## Recommendation

Consider adding a check if `msg.sender == target`.

## [L-05] Delegator can pass an address of a proxy which has already delegated to him

Anyone can establish a "chain delegation" by passing a proxy linked to their own address as the target. In doing so, they delegate to the proxy address (target), which in turn creates another proxy, ultimately leading to the delegation being routed back to the original delegator.

1. Alice delegates 100 tokens to Bob (deploy Proxy1)
2. Carl delegates 50 tokens to Alice (deploy Proxy2)
3. Alice changes her delegation from Bob to Proxy2 (deploy Proxy3), that way she transfers the Vote tokens to Proxy3 which delegates to Proxy2 which delegates to Alice.
