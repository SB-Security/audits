## Summary
Contest Organizer can deploy Proxy and distribute winners' rewards by manually setting the winners and their winning percentage.

## Vulnerability Details
Consider this example:

Trusted `ProxyFactory` owner, set a contest, and in the `setContest()` function, pass an organizer and other related parameters.

After the contest reaches its close time, the organizer calls `deployProxyAndDistribute()` and passes the winners and their percentage of the prize. But there are no restrictions on who can be the winner, so the organizer can pass himself (or his friends who participated in solving the problem) and get the prize.

## Impact
Critical for the people who participated and are waiting for their rewards, because they will do the work, but the organizer can get the money for himself without any effort.

## Tools Used
Manual

## Recommendations
Keep the people involved in solving the problem and limit the organizer, sponsor, or owner of ProxyFactory.sol from being passed as a winner. Then when passing winners, each of them must exist in the participant mapping for example.

## Summary
Possibility of passing an array of winners which contains an element of address(0), as an argument to distribute function in the **implementation contract**.
## Vulnerability Details
```solidity
src/Distibutor.sol

uint256 winnersLength = winners.length; // cache length
for (uint256 i; i < winnersLength;) {
    uint256 amount = totalAmount * percentages[i] / BASIS_POINTS;
    erc20.safeTransfer(winners[i], amount);
    unchecked {
        ++i;
    }
}
```
## Impact
Given the fact that `distribute` is called through the proxy and the arguments are passed as array of **bytes**, the ability to pass an array where one or more of the addresses is equal to address(0) and send the **rewards** of the owner and organizer to the address(0) , the vulnerability is decent. 

If that happens there will be big loss of trust in the protocol from all of the users.
## Tools Used
Manual
## Recommendations
```solidity
uint256 winnersLength = winners.length; // cache length
for (uint256 i; i < winnersLength;) {
+   require(winners[i] != address(0));
    
    uint256 amount = totalAmount * percentages[i] / BASIS_POINTS;
    erc20.safeTransfer(winners[i], amount);
    unchecked {
        ++i;
    }
}
```

## Summary
Event is not emitted on transfer commission.

## Vulnerability Details
The `_commissionTransfer()` in the `Distributor.sol` (implementation) doesnâ€™t emit an event.
```solidity
src/Distibutor.sol

function _commissionTransfer(IERC20 token) internal {
    token.safeTransfer(STADIUM_ADDRESS, token.balanceOf(address(this)));
}
```

## Impact
The person set to receive the commission or the end user may wish to receive updates about state changes.

## Tools Used
Manual

## Recommendations
```solidity
function _commissionTransfer(IERC20 token) internal {
    uint256 commissionAmount = token.balanceOf(address(this));
    token.safeTransfer(STADIUM_ADDRESS, commissionAmount);
    emit CommissionTransfered(STADIUM_ADDRESS, commissionAmount); // event CommissionTransfered(address stadium, uint256 amount);
}
```
