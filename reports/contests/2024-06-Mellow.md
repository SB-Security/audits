## [M-01] `ChainlinkOracle` assumes 1:1 ratio for stETH/ETH

## Summary

ChainlinkOracle will use the `wstETH/stETH` exchange rate for pricing `lpTokens`, meaning it assumes a 1:1 ratio for `stETH/ETH`, which is not true most of the time (**Ξ**0.999900 at the time of writing).

## Vulnerability Detail

The issue stems from the `priceX96` implementations and the fact that there is no way to derive A/B token prices when there is no direct price feed:

```solidity
    function priceX96(
        address vault,
        address token
    ) external view returns (uint256 priceX96_) {
    ...MORE CODE
        priceX96_ = FullMath.mulDiv(
            tokenPrice * 10 ** baseDecimals,//getAnswer
            Q96,
            baseTokenPrice * 10 ** decimals
        );
    }
```

Indeed the first Vault deployment will be only with wstETH as underlying token and in order to calculate its price in terms of ETH we should first derive the rate of `wstETH/stETH` - `wsteth::getStETHByWstETH`

```solidity
  function getAnswer() public view returns (int256) {
      return int256(IWSteth(wsteth).getStETHByWstETH(10 ** decimals));
  }
```

Then stETH/ETH chainlink price feed should be used to multiply and then normalize the decimals. The exact same primer can be found in Lido’s github - https://github.com/lidofinance/wsteth-eth-price-feed/blob/main/contracts/AAVECompatWstETHToETHPriceFeed.sol#L39-L45
Issue with mellow is that wstETH price is calculated in terms of stETH only, and used like that, wrongly assuming stETH and ETH will trade at 1:1 ratio forever. 

## Impact

Arbitrage opportunities in Mellow due to miss-calculated wstETH price in terms of ETH.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Chainlink oracle should be extended to support wstETH as performed in the Lido finance example.
