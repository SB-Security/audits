## [M-01] In case internal/external bribe is changed users can deposit in both old and new bribe

**Description**\
If `setInternalBribeFor` or `setExternalBribeFor` in `VoterUpgradeableV1_2.sol` are called users who have voted in the old bribers will retain their balances as well as adding it to the new briber as well. This is due to the `BribeUpgradeable::withdraw` implementation:

```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 amount, uint256 tokenId) external nonReentrant {
      require(amount > 0, "Cannot withdraw 0");
      require(msg.sender == voter);
      uint256 _startTimestamp = IMinter(minter).active_period();
      address _owner = IVotingEscrow(ve).ownerOf(tokenId);

      // incase of bribe contract reset in gauge proxy
      if (amount <= _balances[_owner][_startTimestamp]) {
          uint256 _oldSupply = _totalSupply[_startTimestamp];
          uint256 _oldBalance = _balances[_owner][_startTimestamp];
          _totalSupply[_startTimestamp] = _oldSupply - amount;
          _balances[_owner][_startTimestamp] = _oldBalance - amount;
          emit Withdrawn(tokenId, amount);
      }
  }
```

**Attack Scenario**\
User votes for given pool and later on this pool’s briber is changed by admin. Note that admin can’t be sure whether there are active votes in for this pool. Then users can simply recast their votes with `VoterUpgradeableV1_2::vote` which will call `VoterUpgradeableV1_2::reset` that is supposed to withdraw from the briber contract, but it will be the new Bribe which has `_balances` = 0 and if statement will be skipped, in order to avoid underflows.

The old briber will not be called and the balance of the user will remain there.

<!-- You must provide a file containing a proof of concept (PoC) that demonstrates the vulnerability you have discovered. -->
2. **Revised Code File (Optional)**
When setting new internal or external bribe for given gauge, make sure to reallocate user votes into the new bribe contract.
